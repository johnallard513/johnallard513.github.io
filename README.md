    <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Page!</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm John Allard, a data scientist with a passion for studying patterns in human behavior and user experience. My goals are to use any available data to help people and businesses make the best decisions for their long term goals. I believe the role of a data scientist is to communicate their results clearly and effectively, so that even someone who isn't an expert in the field can understand your findings. Python is my coding language of choice, but I'm also fluent in R and SQL.</p>

## Portfolio

<p>[Fuel Efficiency Study](https://github.com/johnallard513/Fuel_Efficiency)</p>

<p>This was originaly my milestone project in the MIT Applied Data Science Program. But after I finished the course, I expanded it to include a more thorough breakdown of the dataset by manufacturing year and specific engine features.</p>


<p>[AirBNB Prediction Model](https://github.com/johnallard513/AirBNBAnalysis)</p>

<p>This project was based on a Kaggle dataset of ~78000 AirBNB profiles. In it, I created neural networks to predict the review scores and prices of AirBNB rentals, and calculated which amenities had the greatest impact on the predictions.</p>
